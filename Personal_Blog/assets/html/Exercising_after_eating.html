        Can I exercise immediately after eating?<br>
        This answer depends on three basic things: <br>the type and quantity of food and the type of sport or exercise
        Food varies, how quickly the body absorbs it, and how the body digests it.<br>
        According to what we eat and the amount you eat, the time we must wait to do the exercise depends
        As well as exercise and its strength has an impact on that.<br><br>
<br>
<font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >1- Type of food:</font><br><br> <img src="/assets/imgs/type_of_food.jpg" height="350px" width="70%"><br><br>
        Fats take more time to digest than carbohydrates and proteins, so the more fatty the meal that precedes sports, the longer your body will need to digest it, 
       <br> and thus the longer it will take to start exercising.<br>
Also, a snack half an hour to an hour before exercise is allowed and does not harm, but it must be light,<br>
 consisting of carbohydrates as an essential part and a little protein, for example, a banana and peanut butter.<br><br><br>

 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >2- The amount of food:</font><br><br> <img src="/assets/imgs/2560_3.jpg" height="350px" width="70%"><br><br>
 The larger the amount of food, the longer your body will need to digest it. 
 Eating a large or unhealthy meal requires you to wait up to three hours to be able to exercise.<br><br><br>

 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >3- Type of exercise:</font><br><br> <img src="/assets/imgs/Burpee-EVO-Fitness.jpg" height="350px" width="70%"><br><br>
 The more the sport that you will do requires more energy and more muscles, 
 <br>such as (full body exercises / high impact cardio or HIIT / leg exercises), 
 the more time you will need before starting the exercise.
 <br><br><hr/>
<br>
<u style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: x-large;" > <u></u>Why do we have to wait to exercise after eating? </u></font><br><br>
 The body needs blood to complete the digestion process in the best way, and when digestion pumps blood to the stomach and intestines, and when exercising, the body begins to distribute blood to the muscles that are used in exercise, and thus the blood in the digestive system decreases,
  and the result is a feeling of nausea and perhaps vomiting.
  <br><br><BR>
   <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: x-large; " > <u>Is there a risk of nausea after exercise?</u></font><br><br>
    No, there is no danger, but this nausea is a result of the digestive system not working properly, and this nausea goes away within an hour or a little more, so there is no need for concern, 
    but rather it is preferable to avoid exercising immediately after eating to avoid nausea or vomiting.
