            We may sometimes need moral stimulation to perform our duties, especially those that consume our energy. Exercising on a daily or almost daily basis is a basis for a healthy life and weight loss. We also know the importance of sport and 
            its benefits, but we do not practice it on some days. energy or motivation. Here are some motivational ideas<br><br>

            <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 1. Buy new gym clothes </font><br>
Buying new sports clothes in new colors and a new style gives a beautiful and enthusiastic feeling, and the most important thing is that it makes you feel the desire to perform your exercises in your new clothes, and wearing sports
 clothes on a daily and regular basis makes you feel energetic and encourages you to exercise at any time.<br><br><br><br>



 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 2. A little is enough</font><br>
Sometimes we think that we have to exercise for hours in order to get a fit body, and this belief is
 fundamentally wrong! Because it is enough to practice 10 minutes of cardio a day to burn a total of 600 to 700 calories per week
 , so if you are always busy, make sure that you can find those ten minutes a day, and I do not mean that ten minutes a day is enough to change a whole body,
 but little is better than nothing And a little is enough to make a change, even a small one.<br><br><br><br>

 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 3. The duration does not matter</font><br>
As in the previous idea that practicing a little sport is sufficient, as well as the duration of exercise in one session,
 we can collect twenty minutes of exercise per day divided into two sessions, for example, this principle makes you think about
  the possibility of exercising at any 
time you want and for the period you want according to your circumstances and your program.<br><br><br><br>

<font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 4. Reading on sports topics</font><br>
Read on websites and blogs about exercise. Reading different
 topics about exercises and their results will make you excited. Also, search 
 for exercises and sports videos on YouTube. You will be excited to try new exercise routines or new Zumba songs.<br><br><br><br>
 
 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 5. Read about success stories</font><br>
Watching the successes of others gives that feeling that there is nothing impossible, God willing,
 and that if someone else can reach success, then you can also reach, see pictures of before and after losing fat, 
 as these pictures motivate people to exercise because they indicate that sports really change bodies and that exercise Exercising is
 what got others from a “before image” to an “after image” (of course, in addition to a healthy diet).<br><br><br><br>


 <font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > 6. Record your own exercise video</font><br>
 It may seem a bit strange idea, but when you try it, you will feel how excited it is. Just do your usual 
 exercises, but put your phone in front of you and shoot a video during your exercise. You will feel excited to watch that video at the end of the exercise, and your performance 
 will be correct and with greater focus. And you will not feel the passage of exercise time!<br><br><br><br>
