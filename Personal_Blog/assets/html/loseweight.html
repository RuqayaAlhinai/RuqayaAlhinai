      <p style="text-align: left;">Measuring the weight correctly is easy, but it is important because there are many factors that affect the correctness of the measurement. Here you will find the correct way to measure the weight. The restriction in these steps will give the most accurate result of the measurement of weight.<br>
        <br><font style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >First :</font> <br><br>
        the time
        The correct time that you must limit is when you wake up, then the body is free of food and drink, and also after entering the bathroom, that is, you cannot measure your weight in the afternoon or evening period and after food or even after drinking water because all this will increase the number on the miran.<br><br>
        
        <font style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >Secondly :</font><br><br> the clothing
        Your clothes should be very light, or you can put the scale in the bathroom. You will also measure your weight after entering the bathroom and before taking a shower. Clothes, even if you say they have weight, will affect the validity of the number on the scale.
        <br> <br>
        <font style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" >Third :</font><br><br> The scale used for measurement
Changing the type of scale affects the validity of the number, because the scales are not the same accuracy, and you will get 
less weight in one scale and more weight in another scale, so rely on one scale.<br><br>
<font style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: x-large;" >When do you not have to measure your weight?</font><br><br>
<font style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold; color:gray; font-size: large;" >What days should you refrain from measuring your weight?</font><br><br>
Fluid retention in the body: The body retains fluids in some cases, the most common of which is fluid retention due to increased salt in food, which causes swelling and bloating ((In order to get rid of this type of retention, you must drink water in correct and appropriate quantities, at least 2 liters per day Reducing salt in food and avoiding high-sodium foods.
Fluid retention before and during the menstrual cycle, it is normal and common for the body to hold back the question during this period, and you should avoid measuring weight and you should wait until it ends ((Mint tea and cumin are among the herbs that relieve the stomach during the period of the menstrual cycle, as well as drinking water Fluid retention at the beginning and during pregnancy.

    <font style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: large;" > Is the scale the best way to measure body fat loss?</font><br><BR>
        No, the scale only represents weight and does not differentiate between all components of the body such as bones, blood, muscles and fats
The two best ways to know the percentage of body fat are taking measurements in a pipe and using a simple device by which body fat percentage is measured.<br>
